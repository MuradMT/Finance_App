#region Advantages of Unit of Work pattern
/*
The Unit of Work pattern is a design pattern used to manage transactions 
and coordinate changes across multiple repositories in a single business transaction. 
Here are some advantages of using the Unit of Work pattern:

1. **Transaction Management**:
   - **Atomic Operations**: Ensures that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail, 
   maintaining data integrity.
   - **Consistency**: Helps maintain consistency by managing transactions across multiple repositories.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Batching**: Reduces the number of database calls by batching multiple operations into a single transaction.
   - **Reduced Round-Trips**: Minimizes the number of round-trips to the database, which can improve performance.

3. **Simplified Code**:
   - **Centralized Commit/Rollback**: Centralizes the commit and rollback logic, making the code easier to maintain and understand.
   - **Cleaner Code**: Reduces boilerplate code related to transaction management, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

4. **Decoupling**:
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples the business logic from the data access logic, promoting a clear separation of concerns.
   - **Modularity**: Encourages modularity by allowing different parts of the application to work independently with the data layer.

5. **Testability**:
   - **Mocking**: Makes it easier to mock the data access layer in unit tests, improving testability.
   - **Isolation**: Allows for better isolation of tests by managing transactions within the scope of a test.

6. **Consistency Across Repositories**:
   - **Unified Interface**: Provides a unified interface for working with multiple repositories, ensuring consistent behavior.
   - **Coordination**: Coordinates changes across multiple repositories, ensuring that related changes are committed together.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - **Graceful Rollback**: Facilitates graceful rollback of changes in case of errors, ensuring that the system remains in a consistent state.
   - **Centralized Error Handling**: Centralizes error handling related to transactions, making it easier to manage and debug.

In the context of your project, which uses Entity Framework Core for data access, the Unit of Work pattern can be particularly beneficial.
 It can help manage transactions across different repositories, ensure data consistency, and improve the maintainability and testability of your codebase.
